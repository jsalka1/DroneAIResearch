Task: Determine if CARLA or Microsoft AirSim could be useful simulators for teaching AI at Universities.

Carla: 

    Pros: 
        - More realistic environments can be created with less knowledge of Unreal Engine
        - Gives tutorials on how to create your own Vehicle and Sensors
        - Better documentation as of now
    
    Cons: 
    
        - Recommended GPU is an Nvidia RTX 2070. Most students won't have access to this without using University workstations
        - Requires Visual Studio 2017 which means you can't use some features on AirSim
        - Can't access data from sensors live. Have to save it to an image and then view it from there
        
    Sensors:
        - Collision, Depth camera, GNSS sensor, IMU sensor, Lane invasion detector, LIDAR sensor, Obstacle detector
        Radar sensor, RGB camera, RSS sensor, Semantic LIDAR sensor, Semantic segmentation camera, DVS camera
    
    Teaching tools:
    
AirSim

    Pros:
        - Provides less intensive environments for easier and quicker testing
